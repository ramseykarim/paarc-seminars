# Lecture 5: Introduction to Image Processing

This lecture was originally designed by the [GRADMAP](https://www.umdgradmap.org/) team at the University of Maryland, College Park. Their copies can be found [on their Github](https://github.com/astroumd/GradMap/tree/master/notebooks) (https://github.com/astroumd/GradMap/tree/master/notebooks). This was GRADMAP Lecture 4 (it has been renamed Lecture 5 in the PAARC seminar series). It was copied in July 2021 and some small edits have been made. Some material was adopted from a lecture prepared by Alex Dittmann (UMD) and Ramsey Karim (UMD).
